INSTANCE TYPE: DIFFER: CPU,MEMORY,STORAGE,NETWORK
INSTANCE FAMLILY: 	GENERAL PURPOSES: COMMON PURPOSE, BASTION WORKSPACE, NO SPECIAL WORKING 
			COMPUTE OPTIMIZED: C = CPU, ANALYTIC, GAMING, HIGH CPU/RAM RATIO, CHEAPEST PRICE/CORE CPU
			MEMORY OPTIMIZED: M = RAM, DATABASE,CACHE, HIGH RAM/CPU RATIO, CHEAPEST PRICE/GB RAM
			ACCELERATED COMPUTE: HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, AI, DEEP LEARNING, VIDEO ENCODER, HUGE GPU CAPACITY
			STORE OPTIMIZED: HIGH SEQ/RANDOM I/O PERFORMANCE, HIGH DISK THROUGHPUT, MAPREDUCE, HADOOP, DISTRIBUTEDFS
